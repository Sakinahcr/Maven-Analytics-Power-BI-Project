This project is from Udemy Course - _Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence_

## Situation
I’ve just been hired as a Business Intelligence Analyst by AdventureWorks*, a global manufacturing company that produces cycling equipment and accessories

## Brief
The management team needs a way to **track KPIs** (sales, revenue, profit, returns), **compare regional performance, analyze product-level trends**, and **identify high-value customers**.

## The Objective
• Connect and transform the raw data

• Build a relational data model

• Create calculated columns and measures with DAX

• Design an interactive dashboard to visualize the data

## Visualisation
